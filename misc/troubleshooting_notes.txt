problem: commands like ifconfig, iwconfig aren't working
solution: link sbin to path. add the following to .bashrc: export PATH=$PATH:/sbin:/usr/sbin

---

problem: interfaces names are changing after restart (eg. adapter that was previoiusly named wlan2 is switched with wlan0)
solution: Persistent Naming with Systemd-Networkd 
Create Link Configuration Files For each wireless device, create a .link file in /etc/systemd/network/. For example, for the device with MAC address xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx, create:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/10-wlan0.link

Add the following configuration:

[Match]
MACAddress=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

[Link]
Name=wlan0

problem: default motd is annoying
solution: sudo rm /etc/motd
use custom log in message 'welcome.sh'

---

problem: kernal errors, seems to happen after running 'sudo batctl throughputmeter...'
solution?: don't run that test, this seems to be an issue with the current batctl throughputmeter version.

---

problem: dnsmasq not starting
solution: assign an ip to the interfaces that are used, the mesh-networking.service only assigns mesh ip to mesh node, extra adapters need to get ip's set manually. 
'sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces' 
auto wlan1
iface wlan1 inet static
    address 10.10.0.1
    netmask 255.255.255.0
'sudo systemctl restart networking'

---

problem: default wifi configuration blocking batman script (eg. raspberry pi configured to connect to network)
solution: show networkmanager shit 'nmcli connection show' delete connection nmcli connection delete "Wi-Fi connection 1"
after doing this I also had to add this to the .service file 'ExecStartPre=/bin/bash -c 'while ! ip link show wlan0; do sleep 2; done'

---

problem: can't ssh between nodes
solution: install ssh keys to nodes
start ssh agent 'eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"'
add key 'ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa'
verify 'ssh-add -l'

copy public key to server: 'ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@server_ip'

note: create an ssh key just for the mesh, don't upload any critical data/credentials to the nodes since they are not secure*.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
*wireguard can be implemented to encrypt mesh traffic & prevent mitm attacks but requires much more planning and introduces some issues as mesh sizes increase. Maby create a seperate guide for this.

---

problem: getting denied publickey after adding keys
try: Ensure correct permissions for the .ssh directory and key files:

chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Verify ownership of the .ssh directory and files:

chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) ~/.ssh

---

problem: can't reach intenet through gateway
solution: delete default batman route 'sudo ip route del default via 10.0.0.1 dev bat0'
re-add it with lower priority/higher metric 'sudo ip route add default via 10.0.0.1 dev bat0 metric 200'
maby do this in the configuration service?

note. mesh nodes without direct access to wan can set wan gateway with above command
this should be configured in the service and config files
