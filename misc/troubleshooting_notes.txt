problem: commands like ifconfig, iwconfig aren't working
solution: link sbin to path. add the following to .bashrc: export PATH=$PATH:/sbin:/usr/sbin

---

problem: interfaces names are changing after restart (eg. adapter that was previoiusly named wlan2 is switched with wlan0)
solution: Persistent Naming with Systemd-Networkd 
Create Link Configuration Files For each wireless device, create a .link file in /etc/systemd/network/. For example, for the device with MAC address xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx, create:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/10-wlan0.link

Add the following configuration:

[Match]
MACAddress=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

[Link]
Name=wlan0

problem: default motd is annoying
solution: sudo rm /etc/motd
use custom log in message 'welcome.sh'

---

problem: kernal errors, seems to happen after running 'sudo batctl throughputmeter...'
solution?: don't run that test, this seems to be an issue with the current batctl throughputmeter version.

---

problem: dnsmasq not starting
solution: assign an ip to the interfaces that are used, the mesh-networking.service only assigns mesh ip to mesh node, extra adapters need to get ip's set manually. 
'sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces' 
auto wlan1
iface wlan1 inet static
    address 10.10.0.1
    netmask 255.255.255.0
'sudo systemctl restart networking'

---

problem: default wifi configuration blocking batman script (eg. raspberry pi configured to connect to network)
solution: show networkmanager shit 'nmcli connection show' delete connection nmcli connection delete "Wi-Fi connection 1"
after doing this I also had to add this to the .service file 'ExecStartPre=/bin/bash -c 'while ! ip link show wlan0; do sleep 2; done'

---

problem: can't ssh between nodes
solution: install ssh keys to nodes
start ssh agent 'eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"'
add key 'ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa'
verify 'ssh-add -l'

note: create an ssh key just for the mesh, don't upload any critical data/credentials to the nodes since they are not secure*.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
*wireguard can be implemented to encrypt mesh traffic & prevent mitm attacks but requires much more planning and introduces some issues as mesh sizes increase. Maby create a seperate guide for this.
